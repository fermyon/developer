## Prerequisite

Ensure that you have Python 3.10 or later installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you do not have Python 3.10 or later, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

This is the default HTTP trigger template for Python. It installs by default with the [Spin install script](../../spin/install#installing-spin).

This guide walks you through how to use it: [Structure of a Python Component](../../spin/python-components#structure-of-a-python-component)
