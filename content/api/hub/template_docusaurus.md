This is a template for building and statically exporting your Docusaurus application and running it on Fermyon Spin.

All you need to do is open the [spin-docusaurus](https://github.com/VamshiReddy02/spin-docusaurus) repository and install the template in your spin CLI. Once you've created your repository from the template, Run `npm install` and `npx start`, then start editing your application. Alternatively, you can run `spin build` and `spin up` to build and run your application.
