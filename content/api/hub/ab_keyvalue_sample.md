This sample application shows how you can use a Spin application to implement A/B testing based on a cookie.

## Prerequisites

You need the following tools on your machine, to build, run and deploy the application to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_:

- The `spin` CLI
- Rust tools and the `wasm32-wasip1` target
- The `aka` plugin for `spin` CLI
- Access to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_
