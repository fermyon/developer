This is a template for building and statically exporting your Jekyll application and running it on Spin.

All you need to do is open the [spin-jekyll](https://github.com/VamshiReddy02/spin-jekyll) repository and click the "Use this template" button. Before you can build your Jekyll application, make sure to install ` jekyll and bundler gems`. You are now ready to start building your front-end. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and start editing your application. Alternatively, you can run `spin build` and `spin up` to build and run your application.
