This is a template for building and statically exporting your 11ty application and running it on Fermyon Spin.

All you need to do is open the [spin-11ty](https://github.com/VamshiReddy02/spin-11ty) repository and click the "Use this template" button. Once you've created your repository from the template, Run `npm install` and `npx start`, then start editing your application. Alternatively, you can run `spin build` and `spin up` to build and run your application.
