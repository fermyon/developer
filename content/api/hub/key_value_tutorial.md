This sample application was written as part of the [Using the Key Value Store](https://wasm-functions.fermyon.app/wasm-functions/using-key-value-store) tutorial. It showcases how to use the Spin Key-Value store from a Javascript-based Spin application, and guides you on installing it to Fermyon Wasm Functions on Akamai.

## Prerequisites

You need the following tools on your machine, to build, run and deploy the application to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_:

- The `spin` CLI
- Node.js (Version `20` or later)
- The `aka` plugin for `spin` CLI
- Access to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_
