This template creates an HTTP application with no components. It installs by default with the [Spin install script](../../spin/install#installing-spin).

Use this template when you expect to [add](../../spin/writing-apps#adding-a-new-component-to-an-application) multiple components to an application, to help you establish an even directory structure.
