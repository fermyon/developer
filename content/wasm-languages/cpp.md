C++ support for WebAssembly is handled by the [C language support](/wasm-languages/c-lang). And C language support is currently excellent.

However, specific C++ tools are maturing quickly. For example, Cheerp targets compiling C++ to WebAssembly with generated JavaScript interop.

>> Read the [C language guide](/wasm-languages/c-lang) for examples and more coverage of the WASI SDK, Clang, LLVM, and Emscripten

## Usage

For the most part, C++ support comes via C support. Both Emscripten and the C WASI SDK provide support for C++. Recent versions of LLVM and Clang support WebAssembly out of the box.

For this reason, it should be possible to compile C++ code both for browser targets and WASI targets. One thing to be aware of with C++, though, is that exception handling is not yet supported.

## Pros and Cons

Things we like:

- Because C is so well supported, C++ is among the better supported WebAssembly languages
- It is great that common compilers have added support
- We believe C++-centered tooling for WebAssembly is on the rise

We're neutral about:

- Setup is not easy, but it is doable

Things we're not big fans of:

- Features like exception handling are sorely missed

## Examples

See the [example on the C page](/wasm-languages/c-lang#examples).

- Cheerp is an [LLVM-based toolchain for compiling C++ to Wasm and JavaScript](https://github.com/leaningtech/cheerp-compiler). An overview [blog post](https://medium.com/leaningtech/cheerp-2-7-compile-cpp-to-webassembly-plus-javascript-c9b3ef7e318b) explains the basics.
- Mozilla has a tutorial on [Compiling C++ to Wasm with Emscripten](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/C_to_wasm)
- We love this [really cool slide presentation](https://nxxm.github.io/cppcon2018/CPP_EVERYWHERE_WITH_WASM.html#/) with a code walk of C++ in the browser

- The [QT GUI toolkit](https://www.qt.io/) supports [compiling to WebAssembly](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_WebAssembly) for the browser. (We blogged about [LibreOffice in the browser](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/qt-libreoffice-wasm). That uses QT.)
- TutorialsPoint has a tutorial for [compiling C++ to WebAssembly using Emscripten](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/webassembly/webassembly_working_with_cplusplus.htm), but it focuses only on the browser case.
