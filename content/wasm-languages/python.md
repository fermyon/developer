Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and its WebAssembly implementation seems to be coming along quickly.

## Available Implementations

WebAssembly support is officially available in CPython 3.11 and after. The [GitHub CPython repo](https://github.com/python/cpython) has all of the code.

There is also a [Spin SDK for Python](https://github.com/fermyon/spin-python-sdk) that uses CPython, but reduces startup time by preloading and initializing the scripts. There's a [detailed blog post about Python on Fermyon.com](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/spin-python-sdk) that explains this.

## Prerequisite

Ensure that you have Python 3.10 or later installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you do not have Python 3.10 or later, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

The Spin SDK makes it very easy to build Python-based Wasm applications simply by using a Spin template that handles all of the heavy lifting.

## Spin's Python HTTP Request Handler Template

Spin's Python HTTP Request Handler Template can be installed from [spin-python-sdk repository](https://github.com/fermyon/spin-python-sdk/tree/main/) using the following command:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin templates install --git https://github.com/fermyon/spin-python-sdk --update
```

The above command will install the `http-py` template and produce an output similar to the following:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```text
Copying remote template source
Installing template http-py...
Installed 1 template(s)

+---------------------------------------------+
| Name      Description                       |
+=============================================+
| http-py   HTTP request handler using Python |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

**Please note:** For more information about managing `spin templates`, see the [templates section](../spin/v2/cli-reference#spin-templates) in the Spin Command Line Interface (CLI) documentation.

## Example

Let's use Spin's Python HTTP request handler template, to create a new project:

```console
$ spin new python-example -t http-py --accept-defaults
```

## System Housekeeping (Use a Virtual Environment)

Once the app is created, we can change into the `python-example` directory, create and activate a virtual environment and then install the apps requirements:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ cd python-example
```

Create a virtual environment directory (we are still inside the Spin app directory):

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
# python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
$ python3 -m venv venv-dir
```

Activate the virtual environment (this command depends on which operating system you are using):

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
# macOS command to activate
$ source venv-dir/bin/activate
```

The `(venv-dir)` will prefix your terminal prompt now:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
(venv-dir) user@123-456-7-8 python-example %
```

## Requirements

The `requirements.txt`, by default, contains the references to the `spin-sdk` and `componentize-py` packages. These can be installed right there in your virtual environment using:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Take a look at the scaffolded program in `app.py`:

```python
from spin_sdk.http import IncomingHandler, Request, Response

class IncomingHandler(IncomingHandler):
    def handle_request(self, request: Request) -> Response:
        return Response(
            200,
            {"content-type": "text/plain"},
            bytes("Hello from Python!", "utf-8")
        )
```

Change into the app directory and install the requirements:

```console
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Compile a Wasm binary with the scripts preloaded, and then start up a local server:

```console
$ spin build --up
Building component python-example with `componentize-py -w spin-http componentize app -o app.wasm`
Component built successfully
Finished building all Spin components
Logging component stdio to ".spin/logs/"
Preparing Wasm modules is taking a few seconds...


Serving http://127.0.0.1:3000
Available Routes:
  python-example: http://127.0.0.1:3000 (wildcard)
```

Test it with `curl`:

```console
$ curl localhost:3000/
Hello from the Python SDK
```

The file `app.wasm` contains both the interpreter (in an initialized state) and all of the userland code:

```console
$ ls -lah app.wasm
-rw-r--r--  1 technosophos  staff    24M Oct 26 18:22 app.wasm
```

## Troubleshooting

If you bump into issues when installing the requirements.txt. For example:

```console
error: externally-managed-environment
Ã— This environment is externally managed
```

Please note, this error is specific to Homebrew-installed Python installations and occurs because installing a **non-brew-packaged** Python package requires you to either:
- create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv path/to/venv`, or
- use the `--break-system-packages` option in your `pip3 install` command i.e. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages`

We recommend installing a virtual environment using `venv`, as shown in the [system housekeeping section](#system-housekeeping-use-a-virtual-environment) above.
