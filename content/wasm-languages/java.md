Many exciting WebAssembly things are happening in the Java ecosystem.
There are a few projects that are rapidly maturing, and that can generate browser-oriented JS.

The various projects handle memory management differently.
Their feature sets also differ.

## Uses

All of the existing Java implementations are browser oriented, and are designed to let developers write Java and link to it from JavaScript.

## Available Implementations

There is a working [Wasm plus WASI version of TeaVM](https://github.com/fermyon/teavm-wasi) that allows you to run Java apps in Spin and other WASI-compliant runtimes (like WasmTime).

Here's a detailed video by Joel Dice:

- The [Bytecoder project](https://mirkosertic.github.io/Bytecoder/) cross-compiles Java to WebAssembly that can be executed in the browser
- The [TeaVM project](https://teavm.org/) has experimental support for browser-based WebAssembly
- A dedicate WebAssembly compiler called [JWebAssembly](https://github.com/i-net-software/JWebAssembly) can translate any JVM bytecode to WebAssembly, including Groovy, Clojure, and Kotlin. It, too, is browser-centric.
- [CheerpJ](https://leaningtech.com/cheerpj/) is much more ambitious, handling the UI as well

- [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/wasm/) has gained a lot of momentum as a WebAssembly runtime, though it does not appear to support compiling from languages to WebAssembly.
