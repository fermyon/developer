Once you have created and built your application, it's ready to run.  To run an application, use the `spin up` command.

## Specifying the Application to Run

By default, `spin up` looks for a file named `spin.toml` in the current directory.

If your manifest is named something different, or isn't in your current directory, use the `-f` (`--from`) flag. You also use `-f` to run remote applications.

| `-f` Value                      | `spin up` Behavior  |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| File name: `-f demo.toml`       | Runs the specified manifest file |
| Directory name: `-f demo/`      | Looks for a `spin.toml` file in that directory and runs that |
| Registry reference: `-f ghcr.io/fermyon/example:v1` | Pulls the application from the registry and runs that |

> If Spin misunderstands a registry reference as a file name, or vice versa, you can use `--from-file` or `--from-registry` instead of `-f` to disambiguate.

> If you see the error `failed to resolve content at "example.wasm"` (where `example.wasm` is the module file of a component), check that the application has been built.

### Testing HTTP Applications

By default, HTTP applications listen on `localhost:3000`.  You can override this with the `--listen` option.  Spin prints links to the application components to make it easy to open them in the browser or copy them to `curl` commands for testing.

## Application Output

By default, Spin prints application output, and any of its own error messages, to the console.

To hide application output, pass the `--quiet` flag:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin up --quiet
```

To limit application output to specific components, pass the `--follow` flag:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin up --follow cart --follow cart-api
```

## Persistent Logs

By default:

* If you run an application from the file system (a TOML file), Spin saves a copy of the application output and error messages.  This is saved in the `.spin/logs` directory, under the directory containing the manifest file.
* If you run an application from a registry reference, Spin does not save a copy of the application output and error messages; they are only printed to the console.

To control logging, pass the `--log-dir` flag.  The logs will be saved to the specified directory (no matter whether the application is local or remote).

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin up --log-dir ~/dev/bugbash
```

## Trigger-Specific Options

Some trigger types support additional `spin up` flags.  For example, HTTP applications can have a `--listen` flag to specify an address and port to listen on.  See the [HTTP trigger](http-trigger) and [Redis trigger](redis-trigger) pages for more details.

## Monitoring Applications for Changes

Spin's `watch` command rebuilds and restarts Spin applications whenever files change. You can use the `spin watch` [command](https://developer.fermyon.com/common/cli-reference#watch) in place of the `spin build` and `spin up` commands, to build, run and then keep your Spin application running without manual intervention while staying on the latest code and files.

> The `watch` command accepts valid Spin [up](https://developer.fermyon.com/common/cli-reference#up) options and passes them through to `spin up` for you when running/rerunning the Spin application.
E.g., `spin watch --listen 127.0.0.1:3001`

By default, Spin watch monitors:

* The application manifest (`spin.toml` file)
* Any files specified in the `component.build.watch` sections of the `spin.toml` file
* Any files specified in the `component.files` sections of the `spin.toml` file
* The files specified in the `component.source` sections of the `spin.toml` file

If any of these change, Spin will rebuild the application if necessary, then restart the application with the new files.

> Spin watch does not consider changes to a file's metadata (file permissions or when it was last modified) as a change.

The following `spin.toml` configuration (belonging to a Spin `http-rust` application) is configured to ensure that the application is both **rebuilt** (via `cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release`) and **rerun** whenever changes occur in any Rust source (`.rs`) files, the `Cargo.toml` file or the `spin.toml` file, itself. When changes occur in either the Wasm binary file (`target/wasm32-wasi/release/test.wasm`) or the text file (`my-files/changing-file.txt`) the application is only **rerun** using the initial `spin up` command:

 ```toml
[[component]]
// -- snip
files = ["my-files/changing-file.txt"]
source = "target/wasm32-wasi/release/test.wasm"
[component.build]
command = "cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release"
# Example watch configuration for a Rust application
watch = ["src/**/*.rs", "Cargo.toml"]
```

If you would prefer Spin watch to only rerun the application (without a rebuild) when changes occur, you can use the `--skip-build` option when running the `spin watch` command.  In this case, Spin will ignore the `component.build.watch` section, and monitor only the `spin.toml`, `component.source` and `component.files`.

The table below outlines exactly which files `spin watch` will monitor for changes depending on how you run the command. `spin watch` uses the configuration found on every component in your application.

| Files                   | `spin watch` monitors for changes              | `spin watch --skip-build` monitors for changes |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Application manifest `spin.toml`   | Yes                                            | Yes                                            |
| `component.build.watch` | Yes                                            | No                                             |
| `component.files`       | Yes                                            | Yes                                            |
| `component.source`      | No (Yes if the component has no build command) | Yes  

Spin watch waits up to 100 milliseconds before responding to filesystem events, then processes all events that occurred in that interval together. This is so that if you make several changes close together (for example, using a Save All command), you get them all processed in one rebuild/reload cycle, rather than going through a cycle for each one. You can override the interval by passing in the `--debounce` option; e.g. `spin watch --debounce 1000` will make Spin watch respond to filesystem events at most once per second.

> Note: If the build step (`spin build`) fails, `spin up` will not be run.

Passing the `--clear` flag clears the screen anytime a rebuild or rerun occurs. Spin watch does not clear the screen between rebuild and rerun as this provides you with an opportunity to see any warnings.
