This page describes the contents of the Spin manifest file, typically called `spin.toml`.

## Format

The manifest is a TOML file, and follows standard TOML syntax.  See the [TOML documentation](https://toml.io/) for information about the TOML syntax.

## Manifest Fields

| Name                    | Required?  | Type        | Value    | Example   |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| `spin_manifest_version` | Required   | String      | The version of the file format that the rest of the manifest follows. Currently, this value must be `"1"`. | `"1"` |
| `name`                  | Required   | String      | The name of the application. This may be any string of alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores. | `"hello-world"` |
| `version`               | Required   | String      | The version of the application. The must be a string of the form `major.minor.patch`, where each element is a number. | `"1.0.5"` |
| `description`           | Optional   | String      | A human-readable description of the application. | `"The best app for all your world-greeting needs"` |
| `authors`               | Optional   | Array of strings | The authors of the applications. If present, this must ba an array, even if it has only one entry. | `["Jane Q Hacker (<dev@example.com>)"]` |
| `trigger`               | Required   | Table       | The trigger for the application - that is, the kind of event that the application responds to. The table must contain the `type` field, and may contain others depending on the value of `type`. See [The `trigger` Table](#the-trigger-table) for details. | `{ type = "http", base = "/" }` |
| `variables`             | Optional   | Table       | Dynamic configuration variables which the user can set when they run the application. See [The `variables` Table](#the-variables-table) below. | `[variables]`<br />`message = { default = "hello" }` |
| `component`             | Required   | Table array | A manifest must contain at least one `component` table. `component` is always an array, even if there is only one component, so always use double square brackets.  See [The `component` Tables](#the-component-tables) below. | `[[component]]`<br />`id = "hello"` |

## The `trigger` Table

The `trigger` table specifies the events that the application responds to.  The `type` field is always required, but the other fields depend on the `type`.  This section describes the built-in `http` and `redis` trigger types.

> Because the `trigger` table usually contains only a few simple fields, you will usually see it written inline using brace notation, rather than written out using square-brackets table syntax.  For example:
>
> ```toml
> trigger = { type = "http", base = "/" }
> ```

### The `trigger` Table for HTTP Applications

| Name                    | Required?  | Type        | Value    | Example   |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| `type`                  | Required   | String      | Always `"http"` for HTTP applications. | `"http"` |
| `base`                  | Required   | String      | The base path of the application. All component routes are relative to this. It allows multiple applications to be mounted under the same host. | `"/"` |

### The `trigger` Table for Redis Applications

| Name                    | Required?  | Type        | Value    | Example   |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| `type`                  | Required   | String      | Always `"redis"` for Redis applications. | `"redis"` |
| `address`               | Required   | String      | The address of the Redis instance the components are using the message subscriptions. Use the `redis:` URL scheme. | `"redis://localhost:6379"` |

## The `variables` Table

The keys of `variables` table are user-defined.  The value of each key is another table with the fields shown in the following table.

> Because each `variables` value usually contains only a few simple fields, you will usually see the table entries written inline with the values written using brace notation, rather than fully written out using square-brackets table syntax for each variable.  For example:
>
> ```toml
> [variables]
> vessel = { default = "teapot" }
> token = { required = true, secret = true }
> ```

| Name                    | Required?  | Type        | Value    | Example   |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| `default`               | Optional   | String      | The value of the variable if no value is supplied at runtime. If specified, the value must be a string. If not specified, `required` must be `true`. | `"teapot"` |
| `required`              | Optional   | Boolean     | Whether a value must be supplied at runtime. If not specified, `required` defaults to `false`, and `default` must be provided | `false` |
| `secret`                | Optional   | Boolean     | If set, this variable should be treated as sensitive. | `false` |

## The `component` Tables

`component` is a table array, meaning each component is introduced with double-bracket syntax.  Subtables are written using single-bracket syntax or inline JSON syntax.  For example:

```toml
[[component]]
id = "hello"
source = "hello.wasm"
[component.trigger]
route = "/hello"
```

Each table in the `component` array contains the following fields:

| Name                    | Required?  | Type        | Value    | Example   |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| `id`                    | Required   | String      | An identifier for this component, unique within the application. This may be any string of alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores. | `"cart-api"` |
| `description`           | Optional   | String      | A human-readable description of the component. | `"The shopping cart API"` |
| `source`                | Required   | String or table | The Wasm module which should handle the component. This must be built to work with the application trigger. It can be in one of the following formats: | |
|                         |            | String      | * The path to a Wasm file (relative to the manifest file) | `dist/cart.wasm` |
|                         |            | Table       | * The URL of a Wasm file downloadable over HTTP. This must be a table containing a `url` field for the Wasm file, and a `digest` field contains a SHA256 hex digest, used to check integrity. | `{ url = "https://example.com/example.wasm", digest = "sha256:6503...2375" }` |
| `files`                 | Optional   | Array of strings and/or tables | The files to be made available to the Wasm module at runtime. This is an array, and each element of the array is either: | `[ "images/*.jpg", { source = "assets/images", destination = "/pictures" } ]` |
|                         |            | String      | * A file path or glob pattern, relative to the manifest file. The matching file or files will be available in the Wasm module at the same relative paths. | `"images/*.jpg"` |
|                         |            | Table       | * A directory to be made available to the Wasm module at a specific path. This must be a table containing a `source` field for the directory relative to the manifest file, and a `destination` field containing the absolute path at which to make it available. | `{ source = "assets/images", destination = "/pictures" }` |
| `exclude_files`         | Optional   | Array of strings | Any files or glob patterns that should _not_ be available to the Wasm module at runtime, even though they match a `files` entry. | `[assets/images/test/**/*.*]` |
| `allowed_http_hosts`    | Optional   | Array of strings | The host names or addresses to which the Wasm module is allowed to send HTTP requests. If the name includes a port, the Wasm module can send requests only to that port; otherwise, the Wasm module can send requests only to the default port for the scheme it uses. The special string `insecure:allow-all` permits the module to send HTTP requests to _any_ host, but is intended for development use only; some deployment environments may decline to honour it. | `["example.com", "localhost:8081"]` |
| `key_value_stores`      | Optional   | Array of strings | An array of key-value stores that the Wasm module is allowed to read or write. A store named `default` is provided by the Spin runtime, though modules must still be permitted to access it. In current versions of Spin, `"default"` is the only store allowed. | `["default"]` |
| `environment`           | Optional   | Table       | Environment variables to be set for the Wasm module. This is a table. The table keys are user-defined; the values must be strings. | `{ DB_URL = "mysql://spin:spin@localhost/dev" }` |
| `trigger`               | Required   | Table       | Specifies how this component is triggered. This is a table, whose contents of are trigger-specific; see below. | `[component.trigger]`<br />`route = "/..."` |
| `build`                 | Optional   | Table       | The command that `spin build` uses to build this component. See [The `component.build` Table](#the-componentbuild-table) below. | `[component.build]`<br />`command = "npm run build"` |
| `config`                | Optional   | Table       | Dynamic configuration values to be made available to this component. The table keys are user-defined; the values must be strings, and may use template notation as described under [Dynamic Configuration](dynamic-configuration). | `[component.config]`<br />`api_base_url = "https://{{ api_host }}/v1"` |

### The `component.trigger` Table for HTTP Applications

| Name                    | Required?  | Type        | Value    | Example   |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| `route`                 | Required   | String      | The route which this component handles. Requests to the route will cause the component to execute. This may be an exact route (`/example`), which matches on the given path, or a wildcard route indicated by the suffix `/...` (`/example/...`), which matches any route under this prefix. If two routes overlap, requests are directed to the matching route with the longest prefix - see [the HTTP trigger documentation](http-trigger) for details and examples. | `"/api/cart/..."` |
| `executor`              | Optional   | Table       | How Spin should invoke the component. If present, this is a table.  The `type` key is required and may have the values `"spin"` or `"wagi"`. If omitted. the default is `{ type = "spin"}`. See [the HTTP trigger documentation](http-trigger) for details. | `{ type = "wagi" }` |
|                         |            |             | If `type = "spin"` there are no other keys defined. In this case, Spin calls the component using a standard Wasm component interface. Components built using Spin SDKs or Spin interface files use this convention. | `{ type = "spin" }` |
|                         |            |             | If `type = "wagi"`, Spin calls the component's "main" (`_start`) function using [a CGI-like interface](https://github.com/deislabs/wagi). Components built using languages or toolchains that do not support Wasm interfaces will need to be called in this way. In this case, the following additional keys may be set:<br/><br/>* `argv` (optional): The string representation of the `argv` list that should be passed into the handler. `${SCRIPT_NAME}` will be replaced with the script name, and `${ARGS}` will be replaced with the query parameters of the request, formatted as arguments. The default is to follow the CGI specification, and pass `${SCRIPT_NAME} ${ARGS}`<br/><br/>* `entrypoint` (optional): The name of the function to call as the entry point to this handler. By default, it is `_start` (which in most languages translates to `main` in the source code).<br/><br/>See [the HTTP trigger documentation](http-trigger) for details. | `{ type = "wagi" }` |

### The `component.trigger` Table for Redis Applications

| Name                    | Required?  | Type        | Value    | Example   |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| `channel`               | Required   | String      | The Redis channel which this component handles. Messages on this channel will cause the component to execute. | `"purchases"` |

### The `component.build` Table

| Name                    | Required?  | Type        | Value    | Example   |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| `command`               | Required   | String      | The command to execute on `spin build`. | `"cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release"` |
| `workdir`               | Optional   | String      | The directory in which to execute `command`, relative to the manifest file. The default is the directory containing the manifest file. An example of where this is needed is a multi-component application where each component is its own source tree in its own directory. | `"my-project"` |
