## Key Value Store With Spin Applications

Spin applications are best suited for event-driven, stateless workloads that have low-latency requirements. Keeping track of the application's state (storing information) is an integral part of any useful product or service. For example, users (and the business) will expect to store and load data/information at all times during an applicationâ€™s execution. Spin has support for applications that need data in the form of key/value pairs and are satisfied by a Basically Available, Soft State, and Eventually Consistent (BASE) model. Workload examples include general value caching, session caching, counters, and serialized application state. In this tutorial, you will learn how to do the following:

* Create a Spin application with `spin new`
* Use the key value store SDK to get, set, and list key value pairs
* Configure your application manifest (`spin.toml`) to use the default key value store
* Run your key value store Spin application locally with `spin up`

## Tutorial Prerequisites

First, follow [this guide](./install.md) to install Spin. To ensure you have the correct version, you can check with this command:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin --version
```

> Please ensure you're on version 2.0 or newer.

## Creating a New Spin Application

Let's create a Spin application that will send and retrieve data from a key value store. To make things easy, we'll start from a template using the following commands ([learn more](./quickstart#creating-a-new-spin-application-from-a-template)):

{{ tabs "sdk-type" }}

{{ startTab "Rust"}}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin new -t http-rust spin-key-value

# Reference: https://github.com/fermyon/spin/tree/main/examples/rust-key-value
```

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "TypeScript" }}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin new -t http-ts spin-key-value

# Reference: https://github.com/fermyon/spin-python-sdk/tree/main/examples/spin-kv
```

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "Python" }}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin new -t http-py spin-key-value

# Reference: https://github.com/fermyon/spin/tree/main/examples/tinygo-key-value
```

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "TinyGo" }}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin new -t http-go spin-key-value

# Reference: https://github.com/fermyon/spin/tree/main/examples/tinygo-key-value
```

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ blockEnd }}

## Configuration

Good news - Spin will take care of setting up your key value store. However, in order to make sure your Spin application has permission to access the key value store, you must add the `key_value_stores = ["default"]` line in the `[component.<component-name>]` section of the `spin.toml` file, for each component which needs access to the key-value store. This line is necessary to communicate to Spin that a given component has access to the default key value store. A newly scaffolded Spin application will not have this line; you will need to add it. 

> Note: `[component.spin_key_value]` contains the name of the component. If you used a different name, when creating the application, this sections name would be different.

```toml
[component.spin_key_value]
...
key_value_stores = ["default"]
...
```

>> Tip: You can choose between various store implementations by modifying [the runtime configuration](dynamic-configuration.md#key-value-store-runtime-configuration). The default implementation uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) within the Spin framework.

Each Spin application's `key_value_stores` instances are implemented on a per-component basis across the entire Spin application. This means that within a multi-component Spin application (which has the same `key_value_stores = ["default"]` configuration line), each component will access that same data store. If one of your application's components creates a new key/value pair, another one of your application's components can update/overwrite that initial key/value after the fact.

### The Spin TOML File

We will give our components access to the key value store by adding the `key_value_stores = ["default"]` in the `[component.<component-name>] section as shown below:

```toml
spin_manifest_version = 2

[application]
name = "spin-key-value"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <your-name@example.com>"]
description = "A simple application that exercises key-value storage."

[[trigger.http]]
route = "/..."
component = "spin-key-value"

[component.spin-key-value]
...
key_value_stores = ["default"]
...
```


## Write Code to Save and Load Data

In this section, we use the Spin SDK to open and persist our application's data inside our default key/value store. This is a special store that every environment running Spin applications will make available for their application. 

### The Spin SDK Version

If you have an existing application and would like to try out the key/value feature, please check the Spin SDK reference in your existing application's configuration. It is highly recommended to upgrade Spin and the SDK versions to the latest version available.

### Source Code

Now let's use the Spin SDK to:
- add new data
- check that the new data exists
- retrieve that data
- delete data
- check the data has been removed

        Method::Post => {
            // Add the request (URI, body) tuple to the store
            store.set(req.path(), req.body())?;

                "Storing value in the KV store with {:?} as the key",

                }
            }

            (200, None)
        }
        Method::Head => {
            // Like GET, except do not return the value
            let code = if store.exists(req.path())? {
                println!("{:?} key found", req.path());
                200
            } else {
                println!("{:?} key not found", req.path());
                404
            };
            (code, None)
        }
        // No other methods are currently supported

## Building and Running Your Spin Application

Now, let's build and run our Spin Application locally. Run the following command to build your application: 

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin build
$ spin up
```

## Storing and Retrieving Data From Your Default Key/Value Store

Once you have completed this minimal configuration and deployed your application, data will be persisted across requests. Let's begin by creating a `POST` request that stores a JSON key/value object:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
# Create a new POST request and set the key/value pair of foo:bar
$ curl localhost:3000/test -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"foo":"bar"}'
```

We can now use a `HEAD` request to confirm that our component is holding data for us. Essentially, all we want to see here is a `200 OK` response when calling our components endpoint (`/test`). Let's give it a try:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ curl -I localhost:3000/test

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

Perfect, `200 OK`. Now, let's create a `GET` request that fetches the data from our component:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
# Create a GET request and fetch the key/value that we stored in the previous request
$ curl localhost:3000/test

{"foo": "bar"}
```

Great! The above command successfully returned our data as intended.

Lastly, we show how to create a `DELETE` request that removes the data for this specific component altogether:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/test
```

Note how all of the above commands returned `200 OK` responses. In these examples, we were able to `POST`, `HEAD` (check to see if data exists), `GET` and also `DELETE` data from our component.

Interestingly there is one more request we can re-run before wrapping up this tutorial. If no data exists in the component's endpoint of `/test` (which is technically the case now that we have sent the `DELETE` request) the `HEAD` request should correctly return `404 Not Found`. You can consider this a type of litmus test; let's try it out:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ curl -I localhost:3000/test

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

As we can see above, there is currently no data found at the `/test` endpoint of our application.

## (Optional) Deploy Your App To Fermyon Cloud

Optionally, if you'd like to deploy your application and key value store to Fermyon Cloud here are the required steps. 

First, login to your Fermyon Cloud account. If you do not have one already, this will take you through the signup process for a free account. 

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin login

Copy your one-time code:

XXXXXXXX

...and open the authorization page in your browser:

https://cloud.fermyon.com/device-authorization

Waiting for device authorization...
Device authorized!
```

Now that we have our dependencies squared away, let's deploy our application to Fermyon Cloud. From your application root folder, run the following command and opt to allow Fermyon Cloud to create a key value store on your behalf:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin cloud deploy
spin deploy
Uploading spin-key-value version 0.1.0-r234fe5a4 to Fermyon Cloud...
Deploying...
App "spin-key-value" accesses a key value store labeled "default"
Would you like to link an existing key value store or create a new key value store?:
> Use an existing key value store and link app to it
  Create a new key value store and link the app to it
```

>> If you're interested in learning more about how to link your Spin app to different key value store instances on Fermyon Cloud, chek out our Key Value Links and Labels tutorial. 

Congratulations, you have a Spin application and associated key value store running up in Fermyon Cloud! You can visit it by clicking on the Spin application's domain name generated in the CLI output, which has the following pattern: `spin-key-value-<RANDOM>.fermyon.app`.
