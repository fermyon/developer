## Visual Studio Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages. It was recently ranked the most popular developer environment tool (by 82, 000 respondents in the [2021 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021)).

## The Spin Extension

VS Code extensions allow you to add tools to your installation, to support your development workflow. Fermyon's [Spin VS Code Extension](https://github.com/fermyon/spin-vscode) integrates Spin developer tasks into the VS Code editor.

### Installation

The Spin Extension for VS Code can be found in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fermyon.spin-vscode&ssr=false#overview) and can also be installed by searching for Fermyon Spin within the Extensions section of your VS Code editor. The extension downloads and uses a compatible version of Spin by default.

### Supported Spin Commands

At present, the Spin VS Code Extension supports the [spin login](./cli-reference#login), [spin build](./cli-reference.md#build) and [spin deploy](./cli-reference.md#deploy) commands. Simply open your VS Code terminal (from the main VS Code menu bar) to perform these commands.

## Fermyon Cloud and VS Code

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyFSbf04yWY) shows you how to create, build, deploy, update and re-deploy a new Spin application, all from within VS Code. The video is based on using Fermyon Cloud.
