[The Fermyon Cloud](https://cloud.fermyon.com) is a cloud application platform for WebAssembly-based serverless functions and microservices. It enables you to run [Spin applications](/spin), at scale, in the cloud, without any infrastructure setup or maintenance required. You can take the same Spin applications you were running locally with `spin up` and push them to Fermyon Cloud with a simple `spin deploy` command. That's just the beginning; let's take a closer look at what you can learn about with the Fermyon Cloud documentation.

## Open Beta

The Fermyon Cloud is currently an open beta service. This means that Fermyon Technologies does not provide any service-level agreements on the service, including the workloads you choose to deploy. We also reserve the right to break compatibility with:

- The Fermyon Cloud [OpenAPI integration](rest-api). For example, the automatically generated client libraries (that your project can optionally use to integrate with the Fermyon Cloud via REST API) may change
- Support for previous and current versions of the [Spin SDK](/spin)
