You can now see your Spin application’s request count over time in the Fermyon Cloud User Interface (UI). Request count is defined as the number of times your Spin application’s [HTTP trigger](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/http-trigger) has been called while running on Fermyon Cloud. To view an Spin application’s request count data over time, log into Fermyon Cloud and click on the application of interest. Feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/AAFNfS7NGf) and let us know what you think.
