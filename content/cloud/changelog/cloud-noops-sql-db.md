We're thrilled to announce Fermyon Cloud's NoOps SQL Database using SQLite is now in private beta. Spin developers can now persist relational data generated by their Spin application in a database that is provisioned and managed entirely by Fermyon Cloud on their behalf. No need to worry about database operations, connection strings, or resource management with Fermyon Cloud's NoOps SQL Database; we've got you covered. We'd love to hear what you think of the experience. You can sign up for the private beta using [this short form](https://fibsu0jcu2g.typeform.com/to/Brv12FI0#hubspot_utk=xxxxx&hubspot_page_name=xxxxx&hubspot_page_url=xxxxx).
