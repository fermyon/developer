GitHub Actions is a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) platform for GitHub developers. With GitHub Actions, developers can create workflows that build, test and even deploy (to production) pull requests that have been merged into their repositories. Workflows are composed of actions, of which there are thousands, published by companies and individual enthusiasts alike, that automate otherwise mundane, repetitive in-house development tasks.

Fermyon provides a set of actions for working with Spin. For example:

* `fermyon/actions/spin/setup` - installs the Spin CLI and necessary plugins
* `fermyon/actions/spin/push` - pushes a Spin application to a registry
* `fermyon/actions/spin/deploy` - deploys a Spin application to Fermyon Cloud

In this tutorial, you'll create an application and deploy it from GitHub to Fermyon Cloud using the `fermyon/actions/spin/deploy` action. Upon completing this tutorial, you should have a GitHub repository that builds and deploys a Spin application to Fermyon Cloud every time you merge a pull request to `main`. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites 

To ensure the tutorial goes smoothly, please check you have the following:
* Spin 1.0 or above [installed](/spin/quickstart#install-spin). You can check the version using `spin --version`.
* Spin templates [installed](/spin/quickstart#install-a-template). You can check with `spin templates list`.
* The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/) installed.
* A Fermyon Cloud account that is set up via your preferred [GitHub user account](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/remembering-your-github-username-or-email)

## Create a Spin Application in a GitHub Repository

> If you'd like to work with one of your existing Spin applications, and you've pushed that application to GitHub, you can skip this step. Instead, open a command line on your application directory. The tutorial assumes that your application manifest is a file named `spin.toml` in the root directory of your GitHub repository; if that's not the case, you may need to change some details of the workflow.

The first step is to create a GitHub repository for your application. You can do this either on [GitHub's UI](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) or via the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create) using the `gh repo create` command. We'll use the GitHub CLI below for illustrative purposes.

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
# Create the github-actions-tutorial repo on GitHub and clone a working copy.
$ gh repo create github-actions-tutorial --public --clone
```

Now let's create a Spin HTTP application using a template.

{{ tabs "sdk-type" }}

{{ startTab "Rust"}}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin new http-rust github-actions-tutorial --accept-defaults
# Choose y at the prompt
github-actions-tutorial already contains other files. Generate into it anyway? [y/n]
```

> Make sure the name matches the repo you just created, otherwise the application won't be generated into the repo working copy.

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "TypeScript" }}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin new http-ts github-actions-tutorial --accept-defaults
# Choose y at the prompt
github-actions-tutorial already contains other files. Generate into it anyway? [y/n]
```

> Make sure the name matches the repo you just created, otherwise the application won't be generated into the repo working copy.

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "Python" }}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin new http-py github-actions-tutorial --accept-defaults
# Choose y at the prompt
github-actions-tutorial already contains other files. Generate into it anyway? [y/n]
```

> Make sure the name matches the repo you just created, otherwise the application won't be generated into the repo working copy.

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "TinyGo" }}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin new http-go github-actions-tutorial --accept-defaults
# Choose y at the prompt
github-actions-tutorial already contains other files. Generate into it anyway? [y/n]
```

> Make sure the name matches the repo you just created, otherwise the application won't be generated into the repo working copy.

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ blockEnd }}

Push your new application to GitHub:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ cd github-actions-tutorial
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Basic Spin application"
$ git push --set-upstream origin main
```

You've now got a Spin application in GitHub, ready to add a deployment workflow.

## Create a Personal Access Token

When you deploy from the Spin command line, you log into Fermyon Cloud using your browser. Of course, that's not possible in an unattended environment like GitHub Actions. Instead, you'll use a _Personal Access Token_ (PAT). Let's create one now.

1. Open [Fermyon Cloud > User Settings](https://cloud.fermyon.com/user-settings). If you're not logged in, choose the Login With GitHub button.

1. In the "Personal Access Tokens", choose "Add a Token". Enter the name "Tutorial" and click "Create Token".

1. Fermyon Cloud displays the token; click the copy button to copy it to your clipboard.

> Once you close the token dialog, you can't re-open it. Leave the dialog open, or paste the token into a text editor, in case your clipboard accidentally gets overwritten before the end of the next step.

> [Learn more about Personal Access Tokens.](/cloud/user-settings#create-and-manage-a-personal-access-token)

## Save the Personal Access Token as a Repository Secret

For your deployment workflow to use this new PAT, you must save it as a GitHub repository secret. The steps for this are different according to whether you prefer to use the GitHub Web user interface or the command line:

{{ tabs "gh-interact" }}

{{ startTab "GitHub UI"}}

Open the GitHub Web site and navigate to your repository.

Choose the Settings tab.

In the left hand navigation bar, find the Security section and choose "Secrets and variables" > Actions.

Choose the "New repository secret" button.

In the Name box, enter `FERMYON_CLOUD_TOKEN`.

In the Secret box, paste the token you copied above.

![Repository Secret View](/static/image/github-reg-secret-success.png)

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "GitHub CLI" }}

Switch back to your command prompt. Be sure you are in the `github-actions-tutorial` working copy and run:

```bash
$ gh secret set FERMYON_CLOUD_TOKEN
? Paste your secret
```

At the prompt, paste the token you copied above, and press Enter.

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ blockEnd }}

## Create the Deployment Workflow

Finally it is time to create the deployment workflow! A workflow is stored as a YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory.

Make sure you are in your Spin application directory, and create the workflows directory:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
# Create workflows directory (and make parent directory as necessary via the -p option)
$ mkdir -p .github/workflows/
```

Now create a file named `deploy.yml` in that directory:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
# For the sake of example this invokes Visual Studio Code, but you
# can use any text editor from vi to Notepad
$ code .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

Then add the following code to the `deploy.yml` file:

{{ tabs "sdk-type" }}

{{ startTab "Rust"}}

<!-- @nocpy -->

```yml
name: Deploy

# Deploy only when a change is pushed or merged to `main`
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  spin:

```

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "Python"}}

          go-version: "1.20"

      - name: "Install TinyGo"
        uses: rajatjindal/setup-actions/tinygo@v0.0.1
        with:
          version: v0.27.0

      - name: Install Spin
        uses: fermyon/actions/spin/setup@v1

      - name: Build and deploy
        uses: fermyon/actions/spin/deploy@v1
        with:
          fermyon_token: $\{{ secrets.FERMYON_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
```

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ blockEnd }}

Save the file.

## Push the Workflow to GitHub

Now it's time to put our GitHub Action to the test. Run the following commands to push your local changes to the GitHub repository and trigger a Spin application deployment on Fermyon Cloud.

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Deployment workflow"
$ git push
```

You should see a successful run on your GitHub Actions view on GitHub.

![GitHub Actions with Spin app deployed](/static/image/github-action-app-deployed-gh.png)

You should also see your Spin application in Fermyon Cloud.

> You can expand the "Build and deploy" step in the Actions log to see a link to the deployed application.

Congratulations on deploying your first Spin application using GitHub Actions!
