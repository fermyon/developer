## Technical Frequently Asked Questions

- **Why do I see mixed replies from my service during an upgrade?**
  - When doing an upgrade of an application, there is a gradual roll-out happening. This means that requests will hit both the existing and new modules, as the upgrade completes. You will see a pattern like the one below, showing the body reply from an HTTP request:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```text
11:08:13 : Hello from Rust
11:08:18 : Hello from Rust - updated
11:08:19 : Hello from Rust
11:08:23 : Hello from Rust - updated
11:08:24 : Bad Gateway
11:08:26 : Hello from Rust - updated
11:08:27 : Bad Gateway
11:08:29 : Hello from Rust - updated
```

- **Q: It’s been over 72 hours and my custom domain hasn’t successfully verified, now what?** 
  - If you're a Growth or Enterprise plan user, please reach out to [support@fermyon.com](mailto://support@fermyon.com). Otherwise, please go to [Discord's](https://discord.com/invite/AAFNfS7NGf) #cloud channel for assistance. 

- **Q: How do I add a new record?**
  - At this time, you can only add a maximum of 1 custom domain to your Spin application. We do not support additional records at this time. To file a feedback request, please visit [github.com/fermyon/feedback](https://github.com/fermyon/feedback).

- **Can I configure external DNS for my custom domain on Fermyon Cloud?**
  - Fermyon Cloud only supports Fermyon DNS at this time for custom domains. To file a feedback request, please visit [github.com/fermyon/feedback](https://github.com/fermyon/feedback).

- **Unable to redeploy an app on Fermyon Cloud?**
  - If `spin deploy` fails with the error `No channel with app_id xxxx and name spin-deploy`, but the app works locally (via `spin build --up`), please delete the app from your Fermyon Cloud dashboard and try again.
