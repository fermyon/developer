## Fermyon Cloud Account Settings

User settings empower you to take control of your Fermyon Cloud experience. Today, you can:
- create and manage a Personal Access Token (PAT).
- delete your Fermyon Cloud account.

See the relevant sections below, for instructions on how to perform these actions.

### Create and Manage a Personal Access Token

#### Create a PAT

A Personal Access Tokens (PAT) enable continuous integration workflows by providing an alternative to the standard login procedure, which requires you to go through Fermyon Cloud to activate the device code.

Examples of this include deploying your Spin applications to Fermyon Cloud using the [`fermyon/action/spin/deploy` GitHub Action](https://github.com/fermyon/actions#fermyonactionspindeploy). Let's walk through the steps required to create a PAT.

First, [log into](/cloud/quickstart#log-in-to-the-fermyon-cloud) Fermyon Cloud. Hover over your username in the top right corner and select 'User Settings' from the down options.

Now select the "Add a Token" button under the Personal Access Tokens heading.

Enter your preferred token name. We recommend that you use a descriptive name to help you can recall its purpose later.

Be sure to, take the time to, copy your token name and store it in a safe location for later.
