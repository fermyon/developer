> This is the open beta of the Fermyon Cloud. For more info about the limitations and support, please see read the [FAQ](/cloud/faq).

This guide will get you up and running in the Fermyon Cloud in less than two minutes. To do so, we've already made a Spin application ready for you to deploy to the cloud.

## Install Spin

{{ tabs "os" }}

{{ startTab "Linux"}}

Download the `spin` binary using the `install.sh` script hosted on this site:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

<pre class="bash spin-install" id="spin-install-quick"><code>$ curl -fsSL https://developer.fermyon.com/downloads/install.sh | bash
</code></pre>

Then move the `spin` binary somewhere in your path, so you can run it from anywhere. For example:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ sudo mv ./spin /usr/local/bin/spin
```

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "macOS"}}

Download the `spin` binary using the `install.sh` script hosted on this site:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

<pre class="bash spin-install" id="spin-install-quick"><code>$ curl -fsSL https://developer.fermyon.com/downloads/install.sh | bash
</code></pre>

Then move the `spin` binary somewhere in your path, so you can run it from anywhere. For example:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ sudo mv ./spin /usr/local/bin/spin
```

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "Windows"}}

Download <a href="https://github.com/fermyon/spin/releases/latest" class="spin-install" id="spin-install-windows">the Windows binary release of Spin</a> from GitHub.

Unzip the binary release and place the `spin.exe` in your system path.

{{ details "Learn more" "[Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) is an open-source project used for creating, developing, building, running, and deploying Spin applications. It is both a CLI tool and a runtime, and provides SDKs for a variety of programming languages, including, but not limited to, Rust, TinyGo, and C#. \n\n The Spin project provides installers that are supported on Linux (amd64), macOS (amd64 and arm64), and Windows(amd64). \n\n The [Spin](/spin) documentation is a good starting place to learn more about using the framework to develop applications."}}

## Log in to the Fermyon Cloud

Now, let's log in to the Fermyon Cloud. You will be using your [GitHub user account](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/remembering-your-github-username-or-email) to sign in:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin login

Copy your one-time code:

XXXXXXXX

...and open the authorization page in your browser:

https://cloud.fermyon.com/device-authorization

Waiting for device authorization...
Device authorized!
```

This command will generate an authentication code for your current device to be authorized against the Fermyon Cloud. Follow the instructions in the prompt to complete the authorization process.

{{ details "Learn more" "The default behavior of `spin login` is to authenticate with the Fermyon Cloud. The command can authenticate against any instance of the [Fermyon Platform](https://www.fermyon.dev)." }}

## Clone the Quickstart Repo

To make this easy, we've already compiled a Webassembly module and created a Spin application for you to deploy.

Let's go ahead and clone the <https://github.com/fermyon/cloud-start> repository to your computer to retrieve that application:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fermyon/cloud-start && cd cloud-start
```

This command clones the repository into a local directory named `cloud-start`, and then enters that directory.

{{ details "Learn more" "To write your Spin application, you would start by using the command `spin new [template name] [project name]`. This gives you the option to select a template based on your preference of programming language and trigger for your module - e.g., `spin new rust-http my_rust_http_trigger`. \n\n The [Spin quickstart](/spin/quickstart) guides you through creating a Spin application from scratch." }}

## Deploy the Application

Let's deploy the application:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin deploy
```

The `spin` command will run using the Spin binary in your system path and read the Spin application definition file `spin.toml` in the current (`cloud-start`) directory to know what application to deploy.

{{ details "Learn more" "Deploying a Spin application to the Fermyon Cloud includes packaging the application and all the required files, uploading it to a Bindle registry, as well as instantiating the application on the cloud. \n\n You can learn more about the deployment process [here](./deployment-concepts)." }}

## Success

This is what a successful Spin application deployment on Fermyon Cloud looks like:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Uploading cloud_start version 0.1.0+XXXXXXXX...
Deploying...
Waiting for application to become ready... ready
Available Routes:
  cloud-start: https://cloud-start-XXXXXXXX.fermyon.app (wildcard)
```

You can CTRL+Click on the link in the terminal to visit the web application you just deployed.

Congratulations, you've now deployed your first Spin application to the [Fermyon Cloud!](https://cloud.fermyon.com)
