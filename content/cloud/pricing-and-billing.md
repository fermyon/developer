## Fermyon Cloud Pricing
Fermyon Cloud offers subscription plans to help you accomplish your workload goals which require an increase Fermyon Cloud usage. This page covers general information about subscription plans and answers frequently asked questions around [payment](#payment), [refunds](#refund), [support](#support), and [quotas](#quota).

As described in detail on the [Fermyon Pricing page](fermyon.com/pricing), there are 3 different plans we offer to fit your workloads' requirements: Starter, Growth, and Enterprise. 

The Start Plan offers all of Fermyon Cloud services for you to try out, that you can continually run free of charge, within certain usage limits. If you find that you're hitting the upper limits of the Starter Plan, we recommend upgrading your account to the Growth Plan, where you can enjoy the same services with a higher quota limit. Lastly, if the services offered don't quite meet your needs in the Growth Plan, [reach out](mailto:sales@fermyon.com) to the Fermyon team and we'll work to create a customized Enterprise Plan that will best meet your requirements. 

> Please note that Growth and Enterprise Plans are billed on a monthly reoccuring basis. Starter Plan is a free subscription, without an expiration date. 

## General Information

### Payment

**I just signed up for the Growth Plan, when should I expect my first charge?**

You should receive your first charge shortly after signing up for the Growth Plan. You can expect your second charge on the monthly anniversary of your signup.

**What payment methods do you accept?**

We accept all forms of payment supported by our payment partner Stripe. These include:

* Credit and debit cards
* ACH
* SEPA
* Apple Pay / Google Pay

For a full list to accepted payment methods see this [Stripe resource](https://stripe.com/payments/features#payment-options).

**Can I pay every month manually?**

No, at this time Fermyon Cloud only accepts reoccurring payments. If at any point you decide you no longer want to continue with your paid plan, you are eligible to cancel your subscription. 

**What happens if there's an issue with my payment method during a reoccurring charge?**

If payment method is not updated by the next billing date **_or your account is in arrears_**, you will receive an email from Fermyon informing you that the payment method is invalid and requesting an updated, valid form of payment. If the payment method is not updated by the next billing date, your limits will be reverted to the Starter Plan.

**How do I change my credit card used for billing by Fermyon Cloud?**

This can be done online on the [Fermyon Cloud Dashboard's Account Settings](https://cloud.fermyon.com/account-settingsm) under the _Billing_ tab.

**How long is the Starter Plan available? Is there a time limit after which the free tier is unavailable to me?**

At this time the Starter Plan has no time limit. As long as your resource utilization remains below the monthly limits, you can use Fermyon Cloud, for free, as long as you want it to. We reserve the right to change that policy, but for now we’re thrilled to be able to provide this service to you completely free.
