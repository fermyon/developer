We're excited to announce the release of `spin aka` v0.4.4, the latest version of Fermyon Wasm Functions' plugin!

### âœ¨ What's New in `spin aka` v0.4.4

- The `spin aka logs` command now supports limiting the number of log lines received with a `-n` flag. We still support the `--tail` alias if that is what you're used to.
