We're excited to announce the release of the `spin aka` v0.4.0, the latest version of Fermyon Wasm Functions' plugin!

<!-- break -->

This release focuses on making your development experience smoother, especially when collaborating with teammates and deploying your applications. Here’s what’s new:

### ✨ What's New in `spin aka` v0.4.0
* Cleaner, More Consistent Commands
We've refined the sub-command structure and standardized flag names, so it's easier to learn and use `spin aka` day-to-day.

* App Linking for Collaboration
Working with others on the same app? [App linking](/wasm-functions/app-linking.md) now makes it simpler to coordinate and develop together without stepping on each other’s toes.

* Friendlier Error Messages and Help Text
When things go wrong (or if you just need a reminder), you’ll now see clearer, more actionable messages and improved command help.

* Improved Deployment Flow
Deploying your app is now more interactive, guiding you through the process for a smoother experience.
