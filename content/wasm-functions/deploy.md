This article will guide you through deploying a Spin Application to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_. You can deploy your [Spin App](/spin) in just a few steps.

## Prerequisites

### Install the Spin CLI

Before developing a Spin application, you need to have the Spin CLI installed locally. Hereâ€™s a way to install the Spin CLI:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ curl -fsSL https://wasm-functions.fermyon.app/downloads/install.sh | bash
```

{{ details "Additional info" "It's easier if you move the spin binary somewhere in your path, so it can be accessed from any directory. E.g., `sudo mv ./spin /usr/local/bin/spin`. \n\nYou can verify the version of Spin installed by running `spin --version`" }}

### Install the `aka` Plugin

{{ details "Note" "If you installed the Spin CLI following the steps provided above, you can skip this step." }}

In order to interact with Fermyon Wasm Functions (Login, Deploy, etc), you need to install the Fermyon Wasm Functions for Akamai Spin plugin (`aka`). The plugin can be installed using this command:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ spin plugin install --url https://fermyon-neutrino-artifacts-public.s3.amazonaws.com/plugin/aka.json
```

If you've previously installed the `aka` plugin, take a moment to upgrade it to ensure compatibility with the latest features and fixes. To upgrade, run:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ spin plugins update
$ spin plugins upgrade --url https://fermyon-neutrino-artifacts-public.s3.amazonaws.com/plugin/aka.json
```

You can learn more about managing Spin plugins in [this article](../spin/v3/managing-plugins.md).

## Log in to Fermyon Wasm Functions

Once you've installed the `aka` plugin for Spin, you must log in to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_, which requires your GitHub account to sign in:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ spin aka login
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Go to https://login.infra.fermyon.tech/realms/neutrino/device?user_code=AAAA-BBBB and follow the prompts.

Don't worry, we'll wait here for you. You got this.
```

Click the link displayed as part of the output from the `spin aka login` command. Authenticate using your individual GitHub Account and authorize the `spin` CLI for interacting with your _Fermyon Wasm Functions_ account.

## Deploy Your Application

After having signed in to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_, you deploy the application by running the `spin aka deploy` command from within the directory where the `spin.toml` file of your application is located:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ spin aka deploy
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
App 'myapp' initialized successfully.
Deploying application to Fermyon Wasm Functions on Akamai..
Waiting for application to be ready... ready

View application:   https://c8769081-7ae5-4041-a10f-61d344a67da2.aka.fermyon.tech/
```

### Specifying Variables

Spin supports [application variables](/spin/variables). Instead of being static, their values can be updated without modifying the application, creating a simpler experience for rotating secrets, updating API endpoints, and more.

For example, consider a Spin application with the following variable declaration as part of the application manifest (`spin.toml`):

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```toml
[variables]
compression_level = { default = "1" }
```

When deploying the Spin application to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_, you can set variables by providing `--variable` flags and passing key and value using the `key=value` format. See the following `spin aka deploy` command, which changes the value of the `compression_level` variable to `3`:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ spin aka deploy --variable compression_level=3
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Deploying application to Fermyon Wasm Functions on Akamai..
Waiting for application to be ready... ready

View application:   https://c8769081-7ae5-4041-a10f-61d344a67da2.aka.fermyon.tech/
```
