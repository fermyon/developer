## PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that has earned a strong reputation for reliability, robustness and performance. This tutorial will implement a persistent storage solution for _Fermyon Wasm Functions_, using PostgreSQL. In this tutorial, we will be using [NEON](https://neon.tech/pricing)'s free PostgreSQL service.

### Provisioning the Database and Seeding Sample Data

Once you've created a free account with NEON, you're asked to create a _project_, you can customize the settings to your needs and confirm the recommended horizontal scaling settings. 

![Create a free NEON project](/static/image/neon-create-project.png)

With your free project being created, find the _SQL Editor_ and run the following SQL commands to provision the `Products` table and to seed some sample data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Products (
  Id varchar(36) PRIMARY KEY, 
  Name TEXT NOT NULL, 
  Price DOUBLE PRECISION);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO Products (Id, Name, Price)
SELECT 'faac630e-a645-4459-9d7e-751df4016a6e', 'V-Neck T-Shirt', 19.99
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT Id FROM Products WHERE Id = 'faac630e-a645-4459-9d7e-751df4016a6e');

INSERT INTO Products (Id, Name, Price)
SELECT 'c01dce8a-3a50-4ef6-a0f1-7f9f48a238c8', 'Hoodie with Logo', 79.99
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT Id FROM Products WHERE Id = 'c01dce8a-3a50-4ef6-a0f1-7f9f48a238c8');

INSERT INTO Products (Id, Name, Price) 
SELECT '6f062dc2-bbf2-4c6c-8169-3511462cd54b', 'Belt', 14.99
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT Id FROM Products WHERE Id = '6f062dc2-bbf2-4c6c-8169-3511462cd54b');
```

Once you've executed the SQL statements from above, you can run a `SELECT * FROM Products` to verify your database setup. NEON's SQL Editor should render the table contents as shown in the following figure:

![Database Setup in NEON](/static/image/neon-verify-database.png)

> You can find the connection string for your PostgreSQL database from NEON's cloud portal as well. Navigate to the project _dashboard_ and note the connection string, we'll need it for deploying the application to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_.

## Spin and Fermyon Wasm Functions

First, you need to have `spin` CLI installed on your computer. Please use the official _Fermyon Wasm Functions_ Quickstart to both [install](/wasm-functions/quickstart#install-spin) Spin and also [log in](/wasm-functions/quickstart#log-in-to-the-fermyon-wasm-functions) to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_.

## Using Spin Application Templates

The `spin` CLI facilitates the creation of new Spin applications through the use of application templates. You can install Spin application templates using the [official Spin CLI documentation](/spin/v3/managing-templates). The template we are interested in, for this tutorial, is the `http-js` template.

## Creating Our New Spin Application

The official `spin` CLI documentation also has instructions on how to [create a new Spin application](/spin/v3/writing-apps#creating-an-application-from-a-template), from an existing template. Using the docs as a reference, we can create a new Spin application based on the `http-js` template, move into the application directory and install its dependencies as shown here:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ spin new -t http-js -a hello-postgresql 

$ cd hello-postgresql

$ npm install
```

## Configuration

Open the Spin application's `spin.toml` file, add an application variable and link it to the `hello-postgresql` component. This allows modifying the connection string for PostgreSQL without changing the actual source code. Consult the Spin documentation to learn more about [using variables in Spin](/spin/v3/variables).

<!-- @nocpy -->

```toml
[variables]
pg_connection_string = { required = true}

[component.hello-postgresql.variables]
pg_connection_string = "{{ pg_connection_string }}"
```

You will also need to explicitly add the address of your PostgreSQL endpoint to the manifest, so that the Wasm component is allowed to send network requests to it. See the following example, that defines the `allowed_outbound_hosts` property within the component configuration (`[component.hello-postgresql]`) section. 

> **Caution**: Please recognize that for outbound connectivity we must specify the protocol to be `postgres://` and explicitly add the PostgreSQL default port (`5432`) as shown here:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```toml
[component.hello-postgresql]
source = "target/hello-postgresql.wasm"
allowed_outbound_hosts = [
    "postgres://ep-bread-garden-11223344.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech:5432",
]
```

## Implementing the Spin Application

The application we're going to implement will provide common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to interact with products stored in PostgreSQL using HTTP requests. Besides Spin SDK for JavaScript, our application will also use the [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) package as a dependency. To install it, execute the following command from within the application directory:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ npm install uuid --save
```

> **Note**: For the sake of simplicity, we will place all JavaScript code in the `index.js` file generated by `spin new`. Delete its contents and keep on appending the JavaScript snippets shown as part of this tutorial.

We'll start with importing necessary capabilities, defining application constants, two helper functions, and laying out the HTTP API of our Spin application using the `AutoRouter` provided by the `itty-router` module (which is specified as dependency of the app):

```JavaScript
import { Variables, Postgres } from "@fermyon/spin-sdk";
import { AutoRouter } from "itty-router";
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
import { validate as uuidValidate } from 'uuid';

const router = AutoRouter();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

// define application constants
const SQL_CREATE = "INSERT INTO Products (Id, Name, Price) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)";
const SQL_READ_ALL = "SELECT Id, Name, Price from Products ORDER BY Name";
const SQL_READ_BY_ID = "SELECT Id, Name, Price from Products WHERE Id = $1";
const SQL_UPDATE_BY_ID = "UPDATE Products SET Name = $1, Price = $2 WHERE Id = $3";
const SQL_DELETE_BY_ID = "DELETE FROM Products WHERE Id = $1";
const DEFAULT_HEADERS = {
  "content-type": "application/json"
};

// helper function to quickly respond with an HTTP 400
function badRequest(message) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message }), { status: 400, headers: DEFAULT_HEADERS });
}

// helper function to quickly respond with a 404
function notFound(message) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message }), { status: 404, headers: DEFAULT_HEADERS });
}

// Layout the HTTP API

router
    // C(reate) -> Add a new product
    .post("/products", async (request, { connectionString }) => createProduct(await request.arrayBuffer(), connectionString))
    // R(ead) -> Read all products
    .get("/products", async (_, { connectionString }) => readAllProducts(connectionString))
    // R(ead) -> Read a single product using its identifier
    .get("/products/:id", async ({ params }, { connectionString }) => readProductById(params.id, connectionString))
    // U(pdate) -> Update a product using its identifier
    .put("/products/:id", async (request, { connectionString }) => updateProductById(request.params.id, await request.arrayBuffer(), connectionString))
    // D(elete) -> Delete a product using its identifier
    .delete("/products/:id", async ({ params }, { connectionString }) => deleteProductById(params.id, connectionString))
    .all("*", () => notFound("Endpoint not found"));


// Spin application entry point
addEventListener('fetch', async (event) => {
    // if the connection string is not set, return early with a HTTP 500
    const connectionString = Variables.get("pg_connection_string");
    if (!connectionString) {
        event.respondWith(new Response(
          JSON.stringify({ message: "Connection String not specified" }),
            { status: 500, headers: DEFAULT_HEADERS }
          ));
    }

    // Let the HTTP router handle incoming requests
    // pass the connection string as extra
    event.respondWith(router.fetch(event.request, { connectionString }));
});
```

### Implementing the Create Handler

With the design of the HTTP API in place, we could move on and start implementing the different scenarios. First, let's start by implementing the `createProduct` function, which is responsible for persisting new products in the PostgreSQL database using `Postgres` APIs provided through the Spin SDK for JavaScript:

```JavaScript
function createProduct(requestBody, connectionString) {

    // validate the request payload
    let payload = JSON.parse(decoder.decode(requestBody));

    // if payload does not match the expectations, return early by sending an HTTP 400 
    if (!payload || !payload.name || typeof payload.price != "number") {
        return badRequest("Invalid payload received. Expecting {\"name\":\"some name\", \"price\": 9.99}");
    }

    // construct a new Product using user provided data and 
    // by rolling a new UUID 
    const newProduct = {
        id: uuidv4(),
        name: payload.name,
        price: payload.price
    };

    // Open the PostgreSQL connection
    const connection = Postgres.open(connectionString);
    
    // Persist the new product in database
    connection.execute(SQL_CREATE, [newProduct.id, newProduct.name, newProduct.price]);

    // Create an HTTP 201 (Created) response
    let customHeaders = {
        "Location": `/products/${newProduct.id}`
    };
    Object.assign(customHeaders, DEFAULT_HEADERS);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(newProduct), { status: 201, headers: customHeaders });
}
```

### Implementing the Read Handlers

Our Spin application has two different handlers for reading data. The `readAllProducts` is responsible for returning the list of all products from the PostgreSQL database, whereas the `readProductById` is used to retrieve a single product from the database using its identifier. Let's start by looking at the `readAllProducts` function:

```JavaScript
function readAllProducts(connectionString) {
    // open PostgreSQL connection
    const connection = Postgres.open(connectionString);

    // load all products from the database 
    let result = connection.query(SQL_READ_ALL, []);
    // iterate over each row received
    let items = result.rows.map(row => {
        // and construct a JavaScript object containing the data of a particular product
        return {
            id: row["id"],
            name: row["name"],
            price: +row["price"]
        };
    });

    // Create an HTTP response with status code 200
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(items), { status: 200, headers: DEFAULT_HEADERS });
}
```

In contrast, the `readProductById` handler, validates potential UUIDs provided by the corresponding route parameter. If a request was sent to the API with a mal-formatted UUID, the request will be terminated early and an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) is returned to the callee: 

```JavaScript
function readProductById(id, connectionString) {
    // validate UUID 
    if (!uuidValidate(id)) {
        return badRequest("Invalid identifier received via URL");
    }
    
    // open PostgreSQL connection
    let connection = Postgres.open(connectionString);
    
    // retrieve a product using its identifier
    let result = connection.query(SQL_READ_BY_ID, [id]);

     // if we receive 0 rows, respond to the request with an HTTP 404 (Not Found)
    if (result.rows.length == 0) {
        return notFound("Product not found");
    }

    let found = {
        id: result.rows[0]["id"],
        name: result.rows[0]["name"],
        price: +result.rows[0]["price"]
    };

     // Create an HTTP 200 response
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(found), { status: 200, headers: DEFAULT_HEADERS });
}
```

### Implementing the Update Handler

Next on our list is updating an existing product in the database. Again, we'll take the product identifier from the corresponding route parameter. Additionally, we pass the request payload into the `updateProductById`, which we'll use to update individual properties of the product in the database.

```JavaScript
function updateProductById(id, requestBody, connectionString) {
    // validate UUID 
    if (!uuidValidate(id)) {
        return badRequest("Invalid identifier received via URL");
    }
    // validate the payload
    let payload = JSON.parse(decoder.decode(requestBody));
    if (!payload || !payload.name || typeof payload.price != "number") {
        return badRequest("Invalid payload received. Expecting {\"name\":\"some name\", \"price\": 9.99}");
    }

    // construct the updated product
    const product = {
        id: id,
        name: payload.name,
        price: payload.price
    };

    // open PostgreSQL connection
    const connection = Postgres.open(connectionString);
    const updatedRows = connection.execute(SQL_UPDATE_BY_ID, [product.name, product.price, product.id]);
    
    // if update did not affect any rows, return a not found
    if (updatedRows == 0) {
        return notFound("Product not found");
    }

    // construct a HTTP 200 response
    let customHeaders = {
        "Location": `/items/${id}`
    }
    Object.assign(customHeaders, DEFAULT_HEADERS);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(product), { status: 200, headers: customHeaders });
}
```

### Implementing the Delete Handler

Last, but not least let's take care of deleting a product from the PostgreSQL database. The `deleteProductById` function takes the product identifier from the route parameter, validates it and tries to delete the product from the database. If no rows were affected from the delete operation, we will again return an HTTP `404 (Not Found)`, otherwise we respond with a `204 (No Content)`:

```JavaScript
function deleteProductById(id, connectionString) {
    // validate UUID
    if (!uuidValidate(id)) {
        return badRequest("Invalid identifier received via URL");
    }

    // open PostgreSQL connection
    const connection = Postgres.open(connectionString);
    const deletedRows = connection.execute(SQL_DELETE_BY_ID, [id]);
    
    // if delete did not affect any rows, return a not found
    if (deletedRows == 0) {
        return notFound("Product not found");
    }

    // construct a HTTP 204 response
    return new Response(null, { status: 204 });
}
```

## Compiling the Spin Application

To build the application, use the following command:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ spin build
```

The output from the above command will look similar to the following:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Building component hello-postgresql with `npm run build`

> hello-postgresql@1.0.0 build

```

## Running the Spin Application Locally

Let's run the Spin application on your local machine, before we will deploy it to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_. Although you might be familiar with the `spin up` command already, we have to provide the connection string for our PostgreSQL database, by setting the `pg_connection_string` variable in advance of running `spin up`. 

Environment variables prefixed with `SPIN_VARIABLE_` will be accessible by your applications, if a corresponding variable is defined as part of the application manifest (`spin.toml`). 

At the beginning of this tutorial, we added the `pg_connection_string` variable to the application manifest, meaning we could now follow the pattern, set the `SPIN_VARIABLE_PG_CONNECTION_STRING` to tell our application which connection string should be used and run the application with `spin up`:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ SPIN_VARIABLE_PG_CONNECTION_STRING="<YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING>" spin up
```

Executing the command above will produce a similar output to the following:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Logging component stdio to ".spin/logs/"

Serving http://127.0.0.1:3000
Available Routes:
  hello-postgresql: http://127.0.0.1:3000 (wildcard)
```

Use a tool like `curl` to send a `GET` request to the `/products` endpoint at `http://localhost:3000` to retrieve the list of all products from the PostgreSQL database:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ curl -iX GET http://localhost:3000/products
```

In addition to the response body (a JSON array containing all the products), you should see response headers printed to `stdout` similar to this:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
content-length: 326
date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 08:55:21 GMT

[{"id":"f062dc2-bbf2-4c6c-8169-3511462cd54b","name":"Belt","price":14.99},{"id":"c01dce8a-3a50-4ef6-a0f1-7f9f48a238c8","name":"Hoodie with Logo","price":79.99},{"id":"660f8927-cdc1-44c7-bdd1-f4926dbd8445","name":"Plain Hoodie","price":42.99},{"id":"faac630e-a645-4459-9d7e-751df4016a6e","name":"V-Neck T-Shirt","price":19.99}]
```

## Deploy to Fermyon Wasm Functions

To deploy the application to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_, use the `spin aka deploy` command. The actual connection string for accessing the PostgreSQL database will be passed to the command using the `--variable` flag: 

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin aka deploy \
  --variable pg_connection_string="<YOUR_POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE>"
```

The above deploy command will produce similar output to the following:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```bash
Waiting for application to be ready... ready
Application deployed to https://rust-pg-12345678.aka.fermyon.tech/
View application: https://rust-pg-12345678.aka.fermyon.tech/
```

Finally, you can use `curl` to interact with the application you just deployed to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_. First, let's send a `GET` request to the `/products` endpoint to retrieve a list of all products:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ curl https://rust-pg-12345678.aka.fermyon.tech/products
```

You should now see a JSON array containing all products being rendered to your terminal as shown here:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```json
[
  {
    "id": "6f062dc2-bbf2-4c6c-8169-3511462cd54b",
    "name": "Belt",
    "price": 14.99
  },
  {
    "id": "c01dce8a-3a50-4ef6-a0f1-7f9f48a238c8",
    "name": "Hoodie with Logo",
    "price": 79.99
  },
  {
    "id": "faac630e-a645-4459-9d7e-751df4016a6e",
    "name": "V-Neck T-Shirt",
    "price": 19.99
  }
]
```

For demonstration purposes, let's also add a new product to the database by sending a `POST` request to the `/products` endpoint:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ curl -iX POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "Plain Hoodie", "price": 42.99}' \
  https://rust-pg-12345678.aka.fermyon.tech/products
```

Because we passed the `-i` flag to the `curl` command above, you should also see all response headers (including the HTTP status code) returned from our application running on _Fermyon Wasm Functions_:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
content-type: application/json
location: /products/660f8927-cdc1-44c7-bdd1-f4926dbd8445
content-length: 81
date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 09:36:24 GMT

{"id":"660f8927-cdc1-44c7-bdd1-f4926dbd8445","name":"Plain Hoodie","price":42.99}
```

**Congratulations** 🎉, you implemented a fully functional CRUD application and deployed it to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_ using Spin and JavaScript.
