## Install the `aka` Plugin for Spin

In order to interact with Fermyon Wasm Functions (Login, Deploy, etc), you need to install the Fermyon Wasm Functions for Akamai Spin plugin (`aka`). The plugin can be installed using this command:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```
$ spin plugin install aka
```

## Install Language Specific Tooling

With Spin you can build applications using a wide variety of different programming languages. This quickstart, contains instructions and samples for JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust and TinyGo.

Language specific tooling must be installed on your machine, follow these installation instructions:

{{ tabs "sdk-type"}}

{{ startTab "JavaScript"}}

To build Spin apps with JavaScript, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) must be installed on your system. Head over to [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download), to download Node.js.

Once Node.js is installed on your machine, you can check its version using the following command:

```bash
node --version
v22.13.0
```

We recommend Node.js version `22` (or newer).

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "TypeScript"}}

To build Spin apps with TypeScript, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) must be installed on your system. Head over to [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download), to download Node.js.

Once Node.js is installed on your machine, you can check its version using the following command:

```bash
node --version
v22.13.0
```

We recommend Node.js version `22` (or newer).

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "Rust"}}

To build Spin apps with Rust, Rust tooling must be installed on your machine. Head over to [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), to find detailed installation instructions for your operating system.

Once Rust tooling is installed, you’ll need the `wasm32-wasip1` target for Rust.

```bash
$ rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
```

{{ blockEnd}}

{{ startTab "TinyGo" }}

You'll need the TinyGo compiler, as the standard Go compiler does not yet support WASI exports.  See the [TinyGo installation guide](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/).

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ blockEnd}}

## Create a New Spin Application

Next we'll prepare an application with Spin. You can [write an app from scratch](https://spinframework.dev/v3/writing-apps) or use an <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/hub" class="external">existing template</a>. The <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/hub" class="external">Spin Hub <svg class=""  style="width: 0.75rem; height: 0.75rem;" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">  <path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/>  <path d="M11 7h-5a2 2 0 0 0 -2 2v9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h9a2 2 0 0 0 2 -2v-5" />  <line x1="10" y1="14" x2="20" y2="4" />  <polyline points="15 4 20 4 20 9" /></svg></a> has many reference examples and templates:

<div style="margin: 3rem auto;">
{{suh_cards}}
{{card_element "example" "103 Early Hints with HarperDB" "A sample app to query HarperDB for early hints." "https://github.com/fermyon/fwf-examples/tree/main/samples/early-hints-rust" "Rust" true }}
{{card_element "example" "Traffic Splitting & Mirroring" "A traffic monitoring application, demoing traffic splitting workloads." "https://github.com/fermyon/fwf-examples/tree/main/samples/traffic-splitting" "Javascript" true }}
{{card_element "example" "Alter Response Headers" "How to alter the headers as you stream a response from an origin." "https://github.com/fermyon/fwf-examples/tree/main/samples/alter-headers" "Typescript" true }}
{{blockEnd}}
</div>

For the purposes of this guide, we'll use existing code - with the `spin new` CLI command along with a `hello-spin` template to create a new application:

{{ tabs "sdk-type"}}

{{ startTab "JavaScript"}}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin new -t http-js --accept-defaults hello-spin
```

The `http-js` template creates the application boilerplate for you. Once it has finished change to the application directory (`hello-spin`):

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ cd hello-spin
```

From within the application directory install the necessary dependencies using your package manager of choice (we will use `npm` here):

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ npm install
```

The `http-js` template generates an idiomatic JavaScript application. Take a few seconds and explore the source code generated by the template in `src/index.js`:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```javascript
// For AutoRouter documentation refer to https://itty.dev/itty-router/routers/autorouter
import { AutoRouter } from 'itty-router';

let router = AutoRouter();

// Route ordering matters, the first route that matches will be used
// Any route that does not return will be treated as a middleware
// Any unmatched route will return a 404
router
    .get("/", () => new Response("hello universe"))
    .get('/hello/:name', ({ name }) => `Hello, ${name}!`)

addEventListener('fetch', async (event) => {
    event.respondWith(router.fetch(event.request));
});
```

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "TypeScript"}}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin new -t http-ts --accept-defaults hello-spin
```

The `http-ts` template creates the application boilerplate for you. Once it has finished change to the application directory (`hello-spin`):

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ cd hello-spin
```

From within the application directory install the necessary dependencies using your package manager of choice (we will use `npm` here):

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ npm install
```

The `http-ts` template generates an idiomatic TypeScript application. Take a few seconds and explore the source code generated by the template in `src/index.ts`:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```typescript
// For AutoRouter documentation refer to https://itty.dev/itty-router/routers/autorouter
import { AutoRouter } from 'itty-router';

let router = AutoRouter();

// Route ordering matters, the first route that matches will be used
// Any route that does not return will be treated as a middleware
// Any unmatched route will return a 404
router
    .get("/", () => new Response("hello universe"))
    .get('/hello/:name', ({ name }) => `Hello, ${name}!`)

//@ts-ignore
addEventListener('fetch', async (event: FetchEvent) => {
    event.respondWith(router.fetch(event.request));
});
```

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "Rust"}}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin new -t http-rust --accept-defaults hello-spin
```

The `http-rust` template creates the application boilerplate for you. Once it has finished change to the application directory (`hello-spin`):

```bash
$ cd hello-spin
```

The `http-rust` template generates an idiomatic Rust application. Take a few seconds and explore the source code generated by the template in `src/lib.rs`:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```rust
use spin_sdk::http::{IntoResponse, Request, Response};
use spin_sdk::http_component;

/// A simple Spin HTTP component.
#[http_component]
fn handle_hello_spin(req: Request) -> anyhow::Result<impl IntoResponse> {
    println!("Handling request to {:?}", req.header("spin-full-url"));
    Ok(Response::builder()
        .status(200)
        .header("content-type", "text/plain")
        .body("Hello, Fermyon")
        .build())
}
```

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ startTab "TinyGo"}}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin new -t http-go --accept-defaults hello-spin
```

The `http-go` template creates the application boilerplate for you. Once it has finished change to the application directory (`hello-spin`):

```bash
$ cd hello-spin
```

The `http-go` template generates an idiomatic Go(lang) application. Take a few seconds and explore the source code generated by the template in `main.go`:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	spinhttp "github.com/spinframework/spin/sdk/go/v2/http"
)

func init() {
	spinhttp.Handle(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/plain")
		fmt.Fprintln(w, "Hello Fermyon!")
	})
}

func main() {}
```

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ blockEnd }}

## Compile the Application

Use the `spin build` command to compile your Spin app to WebAssembly:

{{ tabs "sdk-type"}}

{{ startTab "JavaScript"}}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin build
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Building component hello-spin with `npm run build`

> hello-spin@1.0.0 build
> npx webpack --mode=production && npx mkdirp target && npx j2w -i dist.js -d combined-wit -n combined -o target/hello-spin.wasm

asset dist.js 5.93 KiB [compared for emit] [javascript module] (name: main)
orphan modules 25.5 KiB [orphan] 25 modules
./src/spin.js + 2 modules 5.95 KiB [built] [code generated]

```

{{ blockEnd}}

{{ startTab "TypeScript"}}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin build
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Building component hello-spin with `npm run build`

> hello-spin@1.0.0 build
> npx webpack --mode=production && npx mkdirp target && npx j2w -i dist.js -d combined-wit -n combined -o target/hello-spin.wasm

asset dist.js 6 KiB [emitted] [javascript module] (name: main)
orphan modules 25.4 KiB [orphan] 25 modules
./src/spin.ts + 2 modules 5.97 KiB [built] [code generated]
webpack 5.97.1 compiled successfully in 509 ms
Using user provided wit in: combined-wit
Successfully written component
Finished building all Spin components
```

{{ blockEnd}}

{{ startTab "Rust"}}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin build
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Building component hello-spin with `cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release`
    Updating crates.io index
     Locking 95 packages to latest compatible versions
     ...
     Compiling hello-spin v0.1.0 (/Users/john/hello-spin)
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 9.89s
Finished building all Spin components
```

{{ blockEnd}}

{{ startTab "TinyGo"}}

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin build
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Executing the build command for component hello-spin: tinygo build -target=wasi -gc=leaking -no-debug -o main.wasm main.go
go: downloading github.com/spinframework/spin/sdk/go v0.10.0
Finished building all Spin components
```

If the build fails, check:

* Are you in the `hello-spin` directory?
* Did you successfully [install TinyGo](#install-language-specific-tooling)?
* Are your versions of Go and TinyGo up to date? The Spin SDK needs TinyGo 0.27 or above.
* Set Environment Variable `CGO_ENABLED=1`. (Since the Go SDK is built using CGO, it requires the CGO_ENABLED=1 environment variable to be set.)
* Are your Spin templates up-to-date? Use `spin templates upgrade` to upgrade them

If you would like to know what build command Spin runs for a component, you can find it in the manifest, in the `component.(id).build` section:

```toml
[component.hello-spin.build]
command = "tinygo build -target=wasi -gc=leaking -no-debug -o main.wasm main.go"
```

You can always run this command manually; `spin build` is a shortcut to save you having to remember it.

{{ blockEnd }}

{{ blockEnd}}

## Test the Application Locally

You can always test your Spin apps on your local computer by using the `spin up` command. The `spin up` command will start an HTTP server on your local machine (port `3000` by default) and instantiate and invoke your Spin application for every request sent to the endpoint:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin up
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Logging component stdio to ".spin/logs/"

Serving http://0.0.0.0:3000
Available Routes:
  hello-spin: http://0.0.0.0:3000 (wildcard)
```

> Note: If port `3000` is already in use, you could set a different port by specifying the `--listen` flag (`spin up --listen 127.0.0.1:3001`).

From within an additional terminal instance, you can use a tool like `curl` to send an HTTP request to your Spin app:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ curl -iX GET http://localhost:3000/
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 14
content-type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 16:10:36 GMT

Hello, Fermyon
```

You can terminate `spin up` at anytime, by pressing `CTRL+C`.

## Log in to the Fermyon Wasm Functions

Once you've installed the `aka` plugin for Spin, you must log in to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_, which requires your GitHub account to sign in:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ spin aka login
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Go to https://login.neutrino.fermyon.computer/realms/neutrino/device?user_code=BB-AA
and follow the prompts.

Don't worry, we'll wait here for you. You got this.
```

Click the link displayed as part of the output from the `spin aka login` command. Authenticate using your individual GitHub Account and authorize the `spin` CLI for interacting with your _Fermyon Wasm Functions_ account.

## Deploy the Application

Finally, let's deploy the application to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin aka deploy
```

The `spin` command will run using the Spin binary in your system path and read the Spin application definition file `spin.toml` in the current (`hello-spin`) directory to know what application to deploy.

{{ details "Learn more" "Deploying a Spin application to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_ includes packaging the application and all the required files, uploading it to an OCI registry, as well as instantiating the application on _Fermyon Wasm Functions_. " }}

## Success

This is what a successful Spin application deployment on Fermyon Wasm Functions looks like:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Pushing app to the Registry....
App 'hello-spin' initialized successfully.
Waiting for application to be ready... ready

Application deployed to https://ac465a57-8d62-443e-a8ed-f50872dd17b7.aka.fermyon.tech/
View application:   https://ac465a57-8d62-443e-a8ed-f50872dd17b7.aka.fermyon.tech/
```

You can `CTRL`+Click on the link in the terminal to visit the web application you just deployed.

Congratulations, you've now deployed your first Spin application to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_!
