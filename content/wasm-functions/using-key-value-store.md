With Spin Key Value Store support in _Fermyon Wasm Functions_, you can persist non-relational data generated by your [Spin](/spin) application across application restarts and updates. _Fermyon Wasm Functions_ will provision and manage the key value store on your behalf, handling the heavy lifting for you. Spin Key Value Stores are isolated to a single application, and components cannot access the store unless explicitly granted permission. This capabilities-based security model ensures that only authorized components can interact with the data. To learn more about the Spin Key Value Store SDK, please visit the [API guide](/spin/v3/kv-store-api-guide).

As part of this tutorial, we will build a Spin application which leverages the Key Value Store provided by _Fermyon Wasm Functions_ for persistence. Once we have finished implementing the Spin app, we will run it locally using `spin up` for testing purposes, before we deploy it to _Fermyon Wasm Functions_ using the `spin aka deploy` command.

## About the Fermyon Wasm Functions Key Value Store

Fermyon Wasm Functions provides key value data storage that is low-latency, persisted, and globally replicated. A replica of the key value store exists in the same geographic area of each Fermyon Wasm Functions compute region, enabling efficient reads and writes. All standard key value operations exhibit read-your-writes behavior within a request.

### Key Value Limitations and Considerations

- WASI KV atomic `increment` and `compare-and-swap` operations will incur higher latencies. Consider using alternative key value operations if latency is a concern.
- Key value stores are currently scoped to applications and cannot be shared between applications.
- Key value query rates are limited to enable experimenting with this feature. Rates can be increased to meet production needs per customer request.

## Creating a New Spin Application

First, let's start by creating a new Spin application using the `http-js` template:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ spin new -t http-js --accept-defaults hello-key-value-store

$ cd hello-key-value-store

$ npm install
```

## Grant Key Value Store Permission

To enable a component in Spin to use a key value store, you need to [grant it the necessary permissions in the application's manifest](/spin/kv-store-api-guide#granting-key-value-store-permissions-to-components) (`spin.toml`) by adding a key-value store label. This both grants the component access to the key value store and signals _Fermyon Wasm Functions_ (FWF) to provision one for the application. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll use the label "default", but you can choose any label that works best for you.

```toml
[component.hello-key-value-store]
key_value_stores = [ "default" ]
```

> When running the Spin application on your local machine for testing purposes, a new SQLite file (`sqlite_key_value.db`) is created in your application's `.spin` folder. The database persists across Spin application invocations and updates.

## Implementing the Spin Application

The `http-js` template generates a simple _Hello World_ example in `src/index.js`. As part of this section, we'll replace the existing code and use the HTTP router, provided by the template, to make our Spin application respond to the following HTTP request patterns:

- `GET /get/:key` for retrieving a value from Key Value Store using the key provided as `:key`
- `POST /set/:key` for storing a value provided as request payload using `:key` in Key Value Store

Let's start by bringing necessary capabilities from the `@fermyon/spin-sdk` package into scope and laying out the routes:

```JavaScript
import { Kv } from '@fermyon/spin-sdk';
import { AutoRouter } from 'itty-router'

const router = AutoRouter();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

// register the GET endpoint
// pass the response object (res) and the route parameter :key to the handleGetValue function
router.get("/get/:key", ({key}) => handleGetValue(key));

// register the POST endpoint
// pass the response object (res), the router parameter :key and the request body to the handleSetValue function
router.post("/set/:key", async (req) => handleSetValue(req.params.key, await req.arrayBuffer()));

// handle incoming requests using the HTTP router
addEventListener('fetch', async (event) => {
    event.respondWith(router.fetch(event.request));
});
```

Incoming `GET` requests at `/get/:key` will be handled by the `handleGetValue` function. As part of the function, we use the Key Value Store APIs provided by the Spin SDK for JavaScript (`import Kv from '@fermyon/spin-sdk'`):

```JavaScript
function handleGetValue(key) {
    // open the Key Value store with label "default"
    // if you specified a different label use the Kv.open("mylabel") function instead
    const store = Kv.openDefault();

    // check if key exists, if not return early with an HTTP 404 
    if (!store.exists(key)) {
        return new Response(null, { status: 404 });
    }

    // load JSON data at key from Key Value Store
    let found = store.getJson(key);

    // Return an HTTP 200 with corresponding HTTP header and payload
    // if something was found at position key in the Key Value Store 
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify(found),
      { status: 200, headers: { "content-type": "application/json" } }
      );
}
```

Incoming `POST` requests at `/set/:key` will be handled by the `handleSetValue` function. After the request payload is validated, we use the Key Value Store APIs for persisting the data.

```JavaScript
function handleSetValue(key, requestBody) {
    // parse the request body using JSON.parse
    let payload = JSON.parse(decoder.decode(requestBody));

    // check if the payload has expected properties
    // otherwise return HTTP 400
    if (!payload || !payload.firstName || !payload.lastName) {
        return new Response("Invalid payload received.\nExpecting {\"firstName\": \"some\", \"lastName\": \"some\"}", { status: 400 });
    }

    // open the Key Value store with label "default"
    // if you specified a different label use the Kv.open("mylabel") function instead 
    const store = Kv.openDefault();

    // store data in the Key Value store at key
    store.setJson(key, payload);

    // return an HTTP 200
    return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

## Testing the Spin Application

You can run the Spin application on your local machine for testing purposes. Use the `spin up --build` command, to compile your source code to WebAssembly and run the application in a single step:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ spin up --build
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
Building component hello-key-value-store with `npm run build`

> hello-key-value-store@1.0.0 build

Available Routes:
  hello-key-value-store: http://127.0.0.1:3000 (wildcard)
```

From within a different terminal instance, we can use `curl` to interact with the Spin application. First, let's send an HTTP `POST` request to `localhost:3000/set/rs` to persist data using the key `rs`:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ curl -iX POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"firstName": "River", "lastName": "Scott"}' \
  localhost:3000/set/rs
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 0
date: Fri, 17 Jan 2025 12:33:35 GMT
```

Finally, let's test receiving data by sending an HTTP `GET` request to `localhost:3000/get/rs`:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ curl -iX GET localhost:3000/get/rs
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
content-length: 40
date: Fri, 17 Jan 2025 12:33:41 GMT

{"firstName":"River","lastName":"Scott"}
```

Move back to the first terminal instance and terminate your Spin application by pressing `CTRL+C`.

## Deploying to Fermyon Wasm Functions

_Fermyon Wasm Functions_ takes care of provisioning a Key Value Store for you. That said, all we have to do is deploying our Spin application using the `spin aka deploy` command:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ spin aka deploy
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console
App 'hello-key-value-store' initialized successfully.
Waiting for application to be ready...         ready
Application deployed to https://524468d8-104d-467d-ac32-24f0c1b0d54b.aka.fermyon.tech/
View application:   https://524468d8-104d-467d-ac32-24f0c1b0d54b.aka.fermyon.tech/
```

Once deployment has finished, we can - again - use `curl` to invoke the Spin application. This time we will send requests to the generated origin of our Spin application running on _Fermyon Wasm Functions_:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ curl -iX POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"firstName": "River", "lastName": "Scott"}' \
  https://524468d8-104d-467d-ac32-24f0c1b0d54b.aka.fermyon.tech/set/rs
```

<!-- @nocpy -->

```console

Akamai-GRN: 0.c428d2bc.1737117760.1aa3356
```

Finally, let's test receiving data by sending an HTTP `GET` request to `localhost:3000/get/rs`:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```console
$ curl -i https://524468d8-104d-467d-ac32-24f0c1b0d54b.aka.fermyon.tech/get/rs
```

<!-- @nocpy -->
