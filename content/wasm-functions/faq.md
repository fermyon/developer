## Technical Frequently Asked Questions

- **Q: Where is Fermyon Wasm Functions available today?**
  - Currently Fermyon Wasm Functions are deployed throughout North America and Europe, with larger geographic coverage coming soon.
- **Q: How is user data structured in Fermyon Wasm Functions?**
  - Each user has an associated account (created implicitly with `spin aka login`), which serves as the primary entity for managing their resources. An account is linked to zero or more Spin applications, allowing flexibility in how users develop and deploy their workloads.
- **Q: How are Spin applications managed within a Fermyon Wasm Functions account?**
  - Each Spin application belongs to a specific account and operates independently, ensuring modularity and security. Applications include metadata, dependencies, and deployment configurations, allowing for scalable and efficient management. If you have additional questions or need further clarification, please reach out to [support](./support.md).
- **Q: How long does a login session last with Fermyon Wasm Functions? Will my Spin applications persist after I’ve been logged out?**
  - Your login session (started by `spin aka login` is persisted until 30 days without activity. To learn more about the `spin aka` plugin, please visit the [reference documentation](/wasm-functions/aka-command-reference).
- **Q: How do I get help with Fermyon Wasm Functions?**
  - We’re here to help! Checkout the [“How Do I get Help” page](/wasm-functions/support) in the developer documentation for next steps.
