This is a quickstart example of using Spin to deploy a Bartholomew CMS instance, locally on your machine. In this quickstart session, we use a Bartholomew site template which contains some pre-built parts (for your convenience). If you would like to build all of the parts separately from source (Spin, Bartholomew, File Server), please see the [contributing section](https://developer.fermyon.com/bartholomew/contributing-bartholomew) which dives a lot deeper than this quickstart example.

## Getting the `spin` Binary

For Spin, follow [the Spin quickstart guide](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/quickstart) which details how to either:
- download the latest Spin binary release,
- clone and build Spin using cargo, or
- clone and build Spin from source.

## Templates

This quickstart method uses a Bartholomew site template. So while we do require `spin` (as per the details above) everything else we need (to launch our Bartholomew CMS website) is packaged up in the Bartholomew site template. Including the `bartholomew.wasm` and the `spin_static_fs.wasm` files which take care of Bartholomew's business logic and [Spin's file server](https://github.com/fermyon/spin-fileserver) needs, respectively. We will start working with the template in the next section.

## Use the Bartholomew Site Template

We can now generate a new repository with the same directory and file structure as the aforementioned Bartholomew site template. Simply visit [the template's location](https://github.com/fermyon/bartholomew-site-template) on [GitHub](https://github.com/fermyon/bartholomew-site-template). Then click on the green `Use this template` button and follow the prompts. This will create a new repository in your GitHub account.

Here are some additional details about [creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) if you are interested.

## Fetch Your Site

Clone the repository which you created in the previous step: 

<!-- @nocpy -->

```bash
$ git clone <your-github-account> <your-repo-name>
```

Navigate into your newly cloned repository:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```bash
$ cd <your-repo-name>
```

## Spin Up Your Site

Issue the following `spin up` command to launch your site on localhost:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin up
Logging component stdio to ".spin/logs/"

Serving http://127.0.0.1:3000
Available Routes:
  bartholomew: http://127.0.0.1:3000 (wildcard)
  fileserver: http://127.0.0.1:3000/static (wildcard)
```

As shown in the output above when you navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, you should see the website running.

## Creating Your Content

Creating content is made easy with the Bartholomew Command Line Interface (CLI) tool. The Bartholomew CLI can create new blog posts in a single command and also validate the content (Markdown files) that you write. Let's go ahead and install the Bartholomew CLI.

### Bartholomew CLI

For the `bart` CLI, there are two options:
- download the latest `bart` binary [release](https://github.com/fermyon/bartholomew/releases/) and add it to your system path, or
- clone and build `bart` from source (requires Rust), using the following commands:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
# Change to home directory
$ cd ~
# Clone Bartholomew repository
$ git clone https://github.com/fermyon/bartholomew.git
# Change into Bartholomew directory
$ cd bartholomew
# Build the Bartholomew CLI
$ make bart
```

> NOTE: The procedure in the example code block above will create the `bart` executable binary file inside the `~/bartholomew/target/release/` directory. Please ensure that this new binary executable is added to your system path.

## Create Your First Blog Post

Ensure you are in the root directory of your previously cloned Bartholomew site template repository:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```bash
$ cd <your-repo-name>
```

You are now ready to start adding content to your new website. You will recall that we installed the `bart` CLI in a previous step. We can use this CLI to create a new blog post page.

Note below how we:
- set the location where the post will be created i.e. `content/blog`,
- set the name of the blog file `protons.md`, and
- specify the `author`, `template` style and `title`.

Feel free to change these values when you run the command on your system:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ mkdir content/blog
$ bart new post content/blog protons.md --author "Enrico Fermi" --template "blog" --title "On the Recombination of Neutrons and Protons"
```

The output from the above command will look similar to the following:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```bash
Wrote new post in file content/blog/protons.md
```

## Validate Your Content

If you would like to check the validity of your content, you can run the following `bart check` command. Notice how we specify the location of the content we want to check. In this case, we are checking all of the Markdown files in the blog directory:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ bart check content/blog/*
```

> NOTE: We are running the above command from within the root directory of the Bartholomew site template repository (i.e. you may need to `cd <your-repo-name>` before running the above command).

If your syntax in the `.md` file is **correct**, you will receive an output similar to the following. Otherwise, you will receive an informative error message and a cross:

<!-- @nocpy -->

```bash
âœ… content/blog/protons.md
```

### Validating Content With Shortcodes

If some of your documents use shortcodes, then the shortcodes directory must be specified via the `--shortcodes` flag, as shown below:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ bart check content/blog/* --shortcodes ./shortcodes
```

## Viewing Your Changes

Running the `spin up` command from above (again) will render the post content at `http://localhost:3000/blog/protons`

Next, let's explore how to [build custom templates for our new website](./templates.md).
