These concepts are derived from undefined an open-source Platform as a Service (PaaS) for WebAssembly. As you deploy your application both an application, a channel and a revision will be created in the Fermyon Cloud.If the application already exists, an upgrade will take place. What happens at this point is that a new revision will be created, and as soon as this is deemed healthy, traffic will start to route to the new revision. The failover from the old to the new revision takes a short amount of time, during which you will be able to observe replies from both revisions. The application existence is determined based on the combination of the user account and the Spin application name, as defined in spin.toml.The deployment process checks for the application health endpoint and finishes once the application is concluded to be healthy by the cloud.

In that previous article, we showed the Spin framework's capabilities of providing WebAssembly executables with access to different levels of on-disk persistence. We demonstrated manually installing Redis from source, running our Redis server on localhost and then reading and writing from Redis via both the Redis CLI itself and also via the Spin SDK. Our current documentation also has examples of using both undefined and undefined, via undefined and undefined services respectively.In all of these previous examples, to persist data within your application, a separate data storage layer is a requirement. These methods of data persistence are perfectly fine and sound to use, as part of your application, if you choose to do so.However, from Spin v0.9.0 onwards, you are no longer required to install any on-disk persistence; outside of just installing Spin itself. SQLite exists inside Spin. SQLite is embedded in a way that is analogous to how one would imagine using a software library i.e. SQLite is designed to be used in this manner and therefore, for all intents and purposes, you could say that SQLite does not exist outside of Spin. When you run your Spin application using the undefined command SQLite is available to your application. When your application is no longer running, neither is SQLite. Your data will continue to persist at all times (including during restarts) and will support the running of your application.In the future, it may be possible to embed other database technologies into Spin (as v0.9.0 has shown here with SQLite). For example, future Spin SDK updates may target other databases such as Redis; which may allow you to build applications using Redis via minimal Spin configuration without the need to locally install and maintain your own Redis instance.Let's get started with creating and deploying your first Spin application that uses this new key/value storage mechanism.","url":"/spin/kv-store.md#redis-postgresql-sqlite"},{"project":"spin","title":"Persistent Data: Spin","subheading":"Tutorial Prerequisites","content":"First, follow undefined to install Spin v0.9.0 or later.
