These concepts are derived from undefined an open-source Platform as a Service (PaaS) for WebAssembly. As you deploy your application both an application, a channel and a revision will be created in the Fermyon Cloud.If the application already exists, an upgrade will take place. What happens at this point is that a new revision will be created, and as soon as this is deemed healthy, traffic will start to route to the new revision. The failover from the old to the new revision takes a short amount of time, during which you will be able to observe replies from both revisions. The application existence is determined based on the combination of the user account and the Spin application name, as defined in spin.toml.The deployment process checks for the application health endpoint and finishes once the application is concluded to be healthy by the cloud.
